# Image Comparison [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romankh3/image-comparison.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romankh3/image-comparison) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/romankh3/image-comparison/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/romankh3/image-comparison?branch=master)
**The program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually by drawing rectandles.**

## Requirements
* Implementation is using only standard core language and platform features, no 3rd party libraries and plagiarized code is permitted.
* Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images) can be visually similar, but have
  different values of RGB. We are only consider 2 pixels to be &quot;different&quot; if the
  difference between them is more than 10%.
* The output of the comparison is a copy of one of the images image with
  differences outlined with red rectangles as shown below.
* No third party libraries and borrowed code are not using.

## Getting Started
To run project write: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/romankh3/image-comparison
$ cd image-comparison
$ ./gradlew run
```

You will get the result of comparing two images.
The images, which are using:

### Image1

Do you see the difference?
